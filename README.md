# React Chip Input Component

Welcome to the React Chip Input Component project! This component allows users to interactively add and remove chips from a list by typing and clicking.

## Specifications

- Click on the input field to reveal a list of items.
- As you type, the list dynamically filters to show only items that match your input.
- Clicking on an item turns it into a chip at the top, and the input field adjusts automatically.
- Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the list to avoid duplication.
- Each chip has an "X" icon, allowing users to remove chips and add items back to the list.
